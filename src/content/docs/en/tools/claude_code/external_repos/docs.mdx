# Claude Code Repositories

This page contains a collection of useful repositories, tools, and resources for Claude Code development.

## Debugging and Tracing

### Claude-Trace
**Repository**: [badlogic/lemmy/apps/claude-trace](https://github.com/badlogic/lemmy/tree/main/apps/claude-trace)

Claude-trace is a debugging tool that records all your interactions with Claude Code as you develop projects, providing visibility into everything Claude normally hides including system prompts, tool outputs, and raw API data through an intuitive web interface. The tool works by intercepting Claude Code's API calls and logging them to JSONL files, then generating self-contained HTML reports with AI-powered conversation summaries and searchable indexes, making it invaluable for understanding and debugging complex Claude Code workflows.

## Analytics and Usage Tracking

### ccusage
**Repository**: [ryoppippi/ccusage](https://github.com/ryoppippi/ccusage)

ccusage is a CLI tool that analyzes token usage and costs for Claude AI conversations by parsing local JSONL files, providing detailed analytics to help users track and understand their AI conversation expenses. The tool offers multiple reporting modes including daily token usage, monthly aggregated reports, session-based tracking, and 5-hour billing window analysis, with features like live monitoring dashboard, real-time token burn rate tracking, per-model cost breakdown, and offline mode support for comprehensive Claude Code usage insights.

## Screenshot and Visual Tools

### Snap-Happy
**Repository**: [badlogic/lemmy/apps/snap-happy](https://github.com/badlogic/lemmy/tree/main/apps/snap-happy)

Snap-Happy is a cross-platform screenshot utility designed for AI assistants, solving the problem of programmatically capturing screenshots across macOS, Linux, and Windows. The tool provides three main functions: retrieving the most recent screenshot as base64 PNG, capturing new screenshots (full-screen or window-specific), and listing visible windows (macOS only), with unique capabilities like capturing specific window content without overlapping windows on macOS and supporting integration with AI assistants like Claude via Model Context Protocol (MCP).
