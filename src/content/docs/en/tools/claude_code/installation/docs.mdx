# Claude Code Installation Guide

Comprehensive installation instructions for Claude Code across different operating systems and environments.

## Windows

This comprehensive Windows installation guide provides a detailed walkthrough for setting up Claude Code on Windows using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). The guide covers essential system requirements (Windows 10 version 2004+ or Windows 11), step-by-step installation through WSL with Ubuntu, Node.js setup, and Claude Code authentication. It emphasizes critical safety practices like avoiding system directories and proper file system navigation between Windows and Linux environments, while providing troubleshooting guidance for common installation issues and WSL configuration challenges.

## General Installation

For general installation instructions across all platforms, refer to the [official Claude Code documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/quickstart).

## Setup after Installation

Additional configuration steps to optimize your Claude Code environment, particularly useful for Windows/WSL users working with Maven projects.

### Maven Windows Wrapper Setup

Maven does not run smoothly from WSL (if both Maven and Repo are not in WSL; and IntelliJ in WSL is not straight-forward, I was not able to get it to work).  
Therefore, a wrapper script is provided to facilitate running Maven commands from WSL while ensuring compatibility with Windows paths and exit codes. 
CLAUDE.md will then be taught to always use the `mvn-win` wrapper instead of the standard `mvn` command.

1. **Create the wrapper script:**
   ```bash
   nano ~/bin/mvn-win
   ```

2. **Add the wrapper content:**
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # Full-featured wrapper

   WIN_PATH=$(wslpath -w "$PWD")
   TEMP_FILE=$(mktemp)

   # Run Maven, capture exit code
   cmd.exe /c "cd /d $WIN_PATH && mvn $* && echo %ERRORLEVEL% > $TEMP_FILE" 2>&1

   # Get Windows exit code
   EXIT_CODE=$(cat $TEMP_FILE)
   rm $TEMP_FILE

   # Exit with same code
   exit ${EXIT_CODE:-0}
   ```

3. **Make the script executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/bin/mvn-win
   ```

4. **Add to PATH:**
   ```bash
   nano ~/.bashrc
   ```
   
   Add the following line:
   ```bash
   export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
   ```

5. **Reload your shell configuration:**
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

6. **Usage:**
   Replace `mvn` with `mvn-win` for your Maven commands:
   ```bash
   mvn-win clean install
   mvn-win spring-boot:run
   ```

This wrapper ensures proper path conversion between WSL and Windows environments, maintaining accurate exit codes for build processes.

## Alternative Beginner Setup Guide
