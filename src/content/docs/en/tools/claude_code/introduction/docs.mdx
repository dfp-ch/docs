# Introduction

## Claude Code

Claude Code is an agentic coding tool designed to streamline software development by integrating directly into a developer's terminal and workflow. Its core purpose is to help developers code faster through natural language commands and deep understanding of their codebase.

The tool emphasizes security and efficiency by connecting directly to Anthropic's API without intermediate servers, operating natively in the developer's terminal, maintaining awareness of the entire project structure, and performing real coding operations like file editing and commit creation. Key capabilities include editing files and fixing bugs across a project, answering questions about code architecture and logic, executing and troubleshooting tests and commands, searching git history and managing version control tasks, and browsing documentation and web resources.
