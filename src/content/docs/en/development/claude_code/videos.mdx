A comprehensive collection of educational videos about Claude Code, covering features, best practices, and advanced workflows.

## [I was wrong about Claude Code (UPDATED AI workflow tutorial)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNR3XI5Eb0k)

This video details a professional developer's switch from the AI coding assistant Cursor to the more powerful, albeit expensive, Claude Code. The presenter justifies the change by highlighting Claude Code's superior ability to reason through and solve complex programming problems that Cursor struggled with. He provides a detailed walkthrough of his new workflow, sharing several real-world examples where Claude Code successfully tackled long-standing and difficult coding challenges. While the recommended $200/month plan makes it a tool for serious professionals, he still recommends Cursor as a great, more affordable option for hobbyists and beginners.

**Key tips and best practices:**

- **Start with Plan Mode:** Before generating code, use `Shift`+`Tab` to enter "plan mode." This allows the AI to think through the problem and propose a plan, which you should review carefully.
- **Use the claude.md file:** Initialize a project with the `/init` command to create a claude.md file. This file serves as the AI's long-term memory and rulebook for that specific project.
- **Commit Frequently with Git:** Claude Code lacks a built-in "restore" feature. Use frequent Git commits as a manual checkpoint system to easily revert any unwanted changes.
- **Provide More Context:** You can drag and drop screenshots (of errors or UI mockups), folders from other parts of your codebase, or even provide URLs to documentation to give the AI more context for its tasks.
- **Leverage Sub-Agents:** For very large or complex tasks, you can ask Claude Code to spin up "sub-agents" to work on different parts of the problem in parallel, which can significantly speed up the process.
- **Always Review the Output:** Treat the code generated by the AI as a pull request from another developer. Always review it thoroughly for correctness and potential issues before integrating it into your project.

## [Claude Code Beginner Guide – Get Started in 20 Minutes (2025)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYiuzAsWnHU)

In the "Claude Code Beginner Guide – Get Started in 20 Minutes (2025)," presenter Alex Finn introduces Claude Code as a superior AI coding assistant that can autonomously build complex applications with minimal user oversight. The video provides a comprehensive guide for beginners, covering everything from pricing plans and installation to a practical demonstration of building a calendar app from scratch. It emphasizes how users, even without prior coding experience, can leverage the tool's powerful planning and execution modes to create and launch applications quickly, positioning Claude Code as a significant step up from other AI tools like Cursor.

**Best tips and practices from the video:**

- **Master Plan vs. Execution Mode:** Use `Shift` + `Tab` to toggle between "plan mode," where the AI outlines its steps, and "execution mode," where it carries out the plan. Understanding this workflow is key to getting good results.
- **Use the Best Model:** If you are on a higher-tier plan, switch to the more powerful Claude Opus model by typing `/model opus` in the terminal for better performance.
- **Create a claude.md Rules File:** In your project's root directory, create a claude.md file to set persistent rules and context for the AI. This ensures it follows specific guidelines for every task in that project.
- **Maintain a To-Do List:** Instruct Claude Code (via your `CLAUDE.md` file) to write its plan to a todo.md file. This creates a trackable to-do list, allowing you to monitor its progress.
- **Ask for Its Opinion:** Before starting a task, ask Claude Code for its suggestions on features or improvements. Its advanced reasoning can often provide valuable ideas you hadn't considered.
- **Multitask:** Since Claude Code works autonomously, you can work on multiple projects at once or use the time it's working to plan your next steps.

**Best tips, tricks, and recommendations from the video:**

- **Initial Setup:** Install the GitHub app (`/install github app`) and customize your allowed tools to streamline the workflow and avoid constant permission prompts.
- **Use Dictation:** On macOS, enable dictation to speak your prompts, allowing for more specific and detailed instructions than typing alone.
- **Start with Q&A:** Begin a session by asking Claude questions about the codebase to understand its capabilities and learn how to prompt it effectively.
- **Plan Before Coding:** For larger tasks, ask Claude to brainstorm or create a plan first. Review and approve the plan before it starts writing any code.
- **Provide Context with claude.md:** Create a `CLAUDE.md` file in your project's root to automatically load project-specific rules, architectural decisions, and tool instructions at the start of every session.
- **Define Reusable Commands:** Use `/claude/commands` files to create custom slash commands for frequently used actions or prompts.
- **Use @ to Mention Files:** Explicitly pull files or folders into the current context by at-mentioning them (e.g., `@src/components/Button.js`).
- **Master Key Bindings:**
  - `Shift` + `Tab`: Accept an edit and switch to auto-accept mode for subsequent edits.
  - `#` (Pound Sign): Tell Claude to remember a specific piece of information, which adds it to the claude.md file.
  - `!` (Exclamation Mark): Temporarily drop into a bash shell to run a local command.
  - `Esc`: Safely stop Claude's current action without losing your session.
- **Leverage the SDK:** Use the Claude Code SDK (`claude -p`) to integrate Claude into CI/CD pipelines, automate incident responses, or build custom tools on top of its capabilities.
- **Work in Parallel:** Run multiple Claude sessions at once using tools like SSH, Tmux, or Git worktrees to work on different tasks simultaneously.
- **Use Images:** Provide visual context by dragging and dropping images directly into the terminal for Claude to analyze.

## [Claude Code - 47 PRO TIPS in 9 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiNpzxoBPz0&t=1s)

This guide, "Claude Code - 47 PRO TIPS in 9 minutes," provides a rapid-fire collection of tips for developers using Claude Code, based on insights from its creator at Anthropic. The video covers a wide range of advanced techniques, from command-line operations and image integration to sophisticated context and cost management strategies. It emphasizes leveraging Claude Code's agentic capabilities, such as launching sub-agents, interacting with databases via MCP servers, and using its deep GitHub integration to automate workflows like filing pull requests and conducting code reviews, ultimately enabling developers to work more efficiently.

**Key pro tips from the video:**

- **Master the CLI:** Use command-line arguments, run headless mode (`-p`), and chain Claude with other tools. You can also run multiple instances or have Claude launch sub-agents.
- **Leverage Images:** Drag-and-drop images or paste screenshots directly into the terminal to provide visual context for UI design, bug reports, or iterative feedback.
- **Use claude.md for Context:** Create a `CLAUDE.md` file in your project root (`/init` command) to provide persistent instructions, style guides, and repository etiquette. Use the `#` symbol to add instructions on the fly.
- **Optimize claude.md:** Regularly refactor your `CLAUDE.md` files to be specific and concise, and use Anthropic's prompt optimizer tool to improve their effectiveness.
- **Create Slash Commands:** Define reusable prompt templates as slash commands in the `.claude/commands` folder for frequent tasks like refactoring or linting.
- **Commit and Revert Often:** Use version control as your safety net. Have Claude commit its own changes after every major step and don't hesitate to revert to a previous state and restart with better instructions if it goes off track.
- **Manage Context Aggressively:** Keep an eye on the context window indicator. Manually compact the context at natural breakpoints or clear it entirely to start fresh and avoid confusion.
- **Use External Memory:** Use GitHub issues or tell Claude to create "scratchpads" for planning its work, which helps keep the main context window clean.
- **Integrate with GitHub:** Install the GitHub CLI or use the GitHub MCP server to allow Claude to file PRs, conduct code reviews, and interact with issues directly.
- **Track Costs:** For teams, use the built-in Open Telemetry support to integrate with tools like DataDog for detailed cost tracking and dashboards. For individuals, consider the flat-rate Max plans to manage costs.

## [Become a Claude Code PRO in just 10 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3evngg1sQI)

This video offers five key tips to help both new and experienced developers enhance their productivity with Claude Code. It emphasizes the strategic use of Model Customization and Personalization servers (MCPs) like Context 7 for documentation and Testmaster AI for breaking down large features. The guide also highlights the importance of using the `/init` command to create a cloud.md file for documenting personal preferences and workflows. It strongly recommends leveraging the built-in planning mode for better control over implementation and suggests that serious developers should consider the "Max" subscription plans for significantly better performance. Finally, it advises installing the IDE extension and enabling diagnostics to allow Claude Code to automatically find and fix errors in the code.

**Key productivity tips from the video:**

- **Use MCPs Strategically:** Leverage Model Customization and Personalization servers (MCPs) to extend Claude's capabilities. For example, use Context 7 to fetch documentation for any technology, Testmaster AI to break down large features into smaller tasks, and database-specific MCPs to interact with your data.
- **Initialize with /init:** Always start a new project by running the `/init` command. This creates a cloud.md file where you can document your specific preferences, workflows, and even reference external playbooks (like prompt engineering techniques) to guide Claude's behavior.
- **Embrace Planning Mode:** Before writing code, always use Claude's planning mode. It analyzes your prompt and codebase to create a step-by-step plan, giving you full control to review and provide feedback before any changes are made.
- **Invest in a Max Plan:** If you are a developer who codes daily, upgrading to a "Max" plan ($100 or $200) is highly recommended. The increased token usage leads to significantly better performance and productivity, making it a worthwhile investment.
- **Install the IDE Extension:** Install the Claude Code extension for your IDE and enable diagnostics. This allows Claude to receive error information (the "red squiggly lines") directly from your editor, enabling it to find and fix typos, type mismatches, and other issues in a continuous loop.

## [Master Claude Code in 14 Minutes (8 Steps)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjW6ofe7AY4&t=28s)

This video offers a guide to mastering Claude Code with eight key tricks for faster, higher-quality coding. The main idea is to establish a clear set of rules for Claude to follow, meticulously plan each task before execution, and continuously save your progress to avoid losing work. The video also highlights the importance of using visual aids for inspiration and bug fixing, maintaining a clean context to prevent errors, and running regular security checks to ensure the code is safe. Finally, it encourages users to learn from the AI to improve their prompting skills and to stay productive during processing times by brainstorming with Claude.

**Key strategies from the video:**

- **Use claude.md for Rules:** Acts as a persistent instruction set for Claude. Recommended rules: break down tasks, seek approval, create task-specific folders.
- **Overuse Plan Mode:** Access via Shift + Tab twice. Describe the goal; let Claude create the plan. Use Opus (/mod opus) for planning, Sonnet (/mod sonnet) for execution to save costs.
- **Use GitHub for Checkpoints:** Compensates for the lack of a built-in rewind feature. Commit after every successful step. Revert to the last commit if Claude introduces an error.
- **Use Images as Input:** UI Inspiration: Screenshot an app and ask Claude to replicate the look. Bug Fixing: Screenshot visual bugs and ask Claude for a fix.
- **Use /clear Frequently:** Clears the conversation context. Reduces hallucinations and lowers token usage (cost). Use after each major task is completed.
- **Run Security Checks:** Adopt a Plan -> Build -> Security Check workflow. Prompt Claude to check for vulnerabilities and ensure sensitive data isn't exposed on the frontend.
- **Learn from Claude:** Extend workflow to Plan -> Build -> Security -> Learn. Ask Claude to explain the code it wrote, acting as a senior engineer. Improves your understanding and future prompting.
- **Stay Productive During Waits:** Avoid distractions ("doom scrolling") while Claude processes. Use the downtime to chat with Claude for brainstorming or reflecting on ideas.
