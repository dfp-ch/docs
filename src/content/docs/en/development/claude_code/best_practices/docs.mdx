# Claude Code Best Practices

A comprehensive guide to maximizing productivity and effectiveness when using Claude Code in your development workflow.

## Essential Setup & Configuration

### Memory Management with CLAUDE.md
Create a comprehensive `CLAUDE.md` file in your project root to provide context and guidelines:

```markdown
# Project Context
- Tech stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js
- Architecture: Microservices with MongoDB
- Testing: Jest with React Testing Library
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions

## Development Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm test` - Run test suite
- `npm run lint` - Check code style
- `npm run build` - Production build

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Prefer functional components
- Use descriptive variable names

## Repository Etiquette
- Always run tests before committing
- Use conventional commit messages
- Create PR descriptions with screenshots
- Update documentation for API changes

## Developer Environment
- Node.js 18+ required
- Use pnpm as package manager
- VS Code with recommended extensions
- Docker for local database

## Known Issues & Warnings
- API rate limits apply after 1000 requests/hour
- File uploads limited to 10MB
- WebSocket connections timeout after 30 minutes
```

### Tool Permissions Configuration
Customize Claude's capabilities for your security needs:

```bash
# View current permissions
/permissions

# Allow specific tools only
/permissions allow bash read write edit

# Disable potentially risky operations
/permissions deny bash
```

### Use the # Shortcut
The fastest way to add memory is to start your input with the `#` character. You'll be prompted to select which memory file to store information in, making it easy to build up your CLAUDE.md file over time.

### Enhanced GitHub Integration
Install GitHub CLI for seamless integration:
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI
gh auth login

# Claude can now create PRs, manage issues, and more
```

### Advanced Configuration with .claude Directory
Create a `.claude/` directory structure for team-wide configuration:

```bash
.claude/
├── settings.json          # Shared team defaults
├── settings.local.json    # Personal overrides (gitignored)
└── commands/             # Custom slash commands
    ├── deploy.md
    ├── test-suite.md
    └── code-review.md
```

#### Team Settings Configuration
**`.claude/settings.json`**:
```json
{
  "allowedActions": [
    "Bash(npm run *)",
    "Bash(git *)",
    "Bash(docker-compose *)"
  ],
  "environmentVariables": {
    "NODE_ENV": "development",
    "DEBUG": "app:*"
  },
  "coAuthorshipEnabled": true,
  "defaultCommitStyle": "conventional"
}
```

**`.claude/settings.local.json`** (personal overrides):
```json
{
  "preferredEditor": "vscode",
  "autoCommit": false,
  "verboseLogging": true
}
```

### Streamlined CLAUDE.md Structure
Focus on essential information for better performance:

```markdown
# Project Goals & Definition of Done
- Feature complete with 90% test coverage
- Performance under 2s load time
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)
- Security audit passed

## Essential Commands
- `npm run dev` - Development server
- `npm run test:watch` - Continuous testing
- `npm run build` - Production build
- `npm run deploy:staging` - Deploy to staging

## Git Workflow
- Feature branches from `main`
- Squash merge for clean history
- PR requires 2 approvals
- Auto-deploy to staging on merge

## Testing Approach
- Unit tests for utilities
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Manual testing checklist in `/docs/testing.md`

## FAQs
Q: How do I reset the database?
A: `npm run db:reset`

Q: Where are environment variables defined?
A: `.env.local` for development, Vercel dashboard for production
```

## Proven Development Workflows

### The Explore-Plan-Code-Commit Pattern
Follow this structured approach for complex tasks:

1. **Explore Phase**
   ```bash
   "Read the authentication module files and understand the current login flow"
   ```

2. **Plan Phase**
   ```bash
   "Create a detailed plan for adding OAuth2 authentication. Break it into steps and identify potential issues."
   ```

3. **Think Mode** (for complex problems)
   ```bash
   "Think through the security implications of this OAuth implementation"
   ```

4. **Code Phase**
   ```bash
   "Implement the first step of the OAuth plan. Focus on the authorization endpoint."
   ```

5. **Commit Phase**
   ```bash
   "Create a commit with a clear message describing what was implemented"
   ```

### Test-Driven Development with Claude
Ensure robust implementations:

1. **Write Tests First**
   ```bash
   "Write comprehensive tests for the user authentication service before implementing it"
   ```

2. **Verify Tests Fail**
   ```bash
   "Run the tests to confirm they fail as expected"
   ```

3. **Implement Solution**
   ```bash
   "Implement the authentication service to make all tests pass"
   ```

4. **Validate Implementation**
   ```bash
   "Run tests again and check for any over-fitting or shortcuts in the implementation"
   ```

### Visual Iteration Approach
For UI/UX development:

1. **Provide Visual Context**
   - Upload screenshots or mockups
   - Share design specifications
   - Include brand guidelines

2. **Implement and Screenshot**
   ```bash
   "Implement this design and take a screenshot of the result"
   ```

3. **Iterate 2-3 Times**
   ```bash
   "The spacing looks off in the screenshot. Adjust the padding and show me the updated version."
   ```

## Advanced Productivity Techniques

### Parallel Development with Git Worktrees
Work on multiple features simultaneously:

```bash
# Create worktree for new feature
git worktree add ../feature-branch feature-branch

# Start Claude in the new worktree
cd ../feature-branch && claude
```

Benefits:
- Run separate Claude Code instances in different branches
- Avoid context switching overhead
- Eliminate the need for stashing changes
- Maintain separate development environments

### Headless Mode for Automation
Integrate Claude into CI/CD pipelines:

```bash
# Run Claude commands programmatically
claude --headless "Run tests and fix any failures"

# Use in shell scripts
#!/bin/bash
claude --headless "Update all dependencies and resolve conflicts"
```

### Custom Slash Commands
Create reusable workflows as markdown files in `.claude/commands/`:

**`.claude/commands/deploy.md`**:
```markdown
# Deploy to Staging

1. Run full test suite
2. Build production assets
3. Deploy to staging environment
4. Run smoke tests
5. Notify team in Slack

Commands:
- `npm run test:all`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run deploy:staging`
- `npm run test:smoke`
```

**`.claude/commands/code-review.md`**:
```markdown
# Code Review Checklist

1. Check test coverage (minimum 80%)
2. Verify no console.log statements
3. Ensure proper error handling
4. Validate TypeScript types
5. Run security audit
6. Generate PR description with screenshots

Commands:
- `npm run test:coverage`
- `npm run lint:no-console`
- `npm audit`
```

### Built-in Slash Commands
Leverage these powerful built-in commands:

```bash
/clear          # Reset conversation context
/review         # Request comprehensive code review
/memory         # Quick edit of project guide
/init           # Initialize CLAUDE.md file
/plan "goal"    # Create structured task breakdown
/finish-work    # Commit changes and create PR
```

### Optimized Developer Loop
Follow this proven 8-step workflow for maximum productivity:

1. **Reset Context**: `/clear` to start fresh
2. **Plan Tasks**: `/plan "implement user authentication"`
3. **Clarify Requirements**: Discuss edge cases and acceptance criteria
4. **Approve Task**: Confirm the plan before implementation
5. **Plan Execution**: Break down implementation and testing strategy
6. **Execute & Test**: Implement code with continuous testing
7. **Finish Work**: `/finish-work` to commit and create PR
8. **Clear Again**: `/clear` for next task cycle

### Bulk-Fix Workflows
For systematic code improvements:

```bash
# Example: Update all deprecated API calls
"Find all instances of the old API calls in the codebase and create a plan to update them to the new format. Process 5 files at a time."

# Example: Security hardening
"Review all authentication-related files and apply consistent security patterns. Focus on input validation and error handling."

# Example: Performance optimization
"Identify performance bottlenecks in React components and implement memoization where beneficial."
```

### Multiple Claude Instances Strategy
Leverage parallel processing:

- **Instance 1**: Frontend development
- **Instance 2**: Backend API work  
- **Instance 3**: Testing and QA
- **Instance 4**: Documentation updates

## Communication Best Practices

### Be Specific and Direct
```bash
# Vague
"Fix the login issue"

# Specific
"In UserService.ts line 45, the JWT expiration check is using wrong timezone. Fix to use UTC and add proper error handling"

# Even Better
"The JWT token validation in UserService.ts:45 fails for users in different timezones. Update the expiration check to use UTC timestamps and add error logging for debugging failed authentications."
```

### Provide Rich Context
```bash
# Include relevant background
"The payment processing module needs to handle new EU regulations. See CLAUDE.md section 'Compliance Requirements' and update the validation logic in PaymentValidator.ts to include GDPR consent checks."
```

### Course-Correct Early
Don't let Claude go down the wrong path:
```bash
# When you notice issues
"Stop - that approach won't work with our current authentication system. Let's use the existing JWT middleware instead."
```

### Use Context Management Commands
```bash
# Clear context when switching topics
/clear

# Focus on specific areas
"Focus only on the frontend components for this discussion"
```

## Code Quality & Security Guidelines

### Security-First Development
- Always review generated code for security implications
- Use secure coding practices in prompts:
  ```bash
  "Add input validation, SQL injection protection, and rate limiting to this API endpoint"
  ```
- Never commit secrets or API keys
- Validate authentication and authorization logic

### Maintain Project Conventions
- Claude Code adapts to your existing code style
- Ensure consistent naming conventions
- Maintain architectural patterns established in your codebase
- Follow established error handling patterns

### Quality Assurance Integration
```bash
# Integrate quality checks
"After implementing this feature, run the full test suite, linting, and security audit"

# Code review preparation
"Generate a comprehensive PR description with testing instructions and security considerations"
```

## Troubleshooting & Optimization

### Context Management Issues
If Claude seems to lack project context:
- Ensure CLAUDE.md is comprehensive and up-to-date
- Provide specific file paths and line numbers
- Share relevant error messages and logs
- Use the `/clear` command to reset context when switching topics

### Performance Optimization
- **Break large tasks** into smaller, focused requests
- **Use specific file targeting** rather than broad searches
- **Maintain clean project structure** for better navigation
- **Batch related operations** together for efficiency

### Common Integration Challenges
- **Network connectivity**: Review API access and firewall settings
- **Authentication issues**: Verify API key configuration
- **Corporate environments**: Check proxy and security policies
- **Tool permissions**: Ensure Claude has necessary access rights

## Advanced Features & Integrations

### Subagent Pattern
For complex problem-solving:
```bash
"Create a subagent to handle the database migration while we work on the API endpoints"
```

### Enterprise Integration
- **Amazon Bedrock**: Enterprise-grade deployment
- **Google Vertex AI**: Cloud-native integration  
- **Development Containers**: Consistent team environments
- **Corporate Proxies**: Seamless network integration

### Automated Workflows
```bash
# Set up automated processes
"Configure Claude to run tests after every code change and report results"

# Pre-commit automation
"Set up a workflow to automatically lint, format, and test code before commits"
```
