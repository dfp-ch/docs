# CLAUDE.md - Claude Code Tools Documentation

## Scope
This memory file is **ONLY applicable to the Best Practices section** at `/src/content/docs/en/tools/claude_code/best_practices/docs.mdx`. 

Do not apply these guidelines to other parts of the documentation site.

## Section Purpose

This section documents recommended practices for working effectively with Claude Code in development workflows. It serves as a comprehensive guide for developers adopting Claude Code.

## Content Management Guidelines

### When Adding New Sections

1. **Add New Content Process:**
   - Insert new sections logically within the existing structure
   - Maintain consistent heading hierarchy (## for main sections, ### for subsections)
   - Follow the established pattern: concept explanation → practical examples → common pitfalls
   - Use code blocks with ❌/✅ examples to show good vs. bad practices
   - Keep sections focused and actionable

2. **Remove Content Duplication:**
   - Check for overlapping concepts across sections before adding new content
   - Consolidate similar guidance into single, comprehensive sections
   - Cross-reference related sections to avoid repetition
   - Ensure examples don't contradict each other

3. **Structure Review Requirements:**
   - Verify logical flow from basic concepts to advanced practices
   - Ensure each section has clear, actionable takeaways
   - Maintain balance between sections (no single section should dominate)
   - Check that section titles accurately reflect their content

4. **Reorganization Triggers:**
   - **When to reorganize:** If adding content creates sections that are significantly longer than others, if new content doesn't fit naturally in existing sections, or if the logical flow becomes unclear
   - **How to reorganize:** Group related concepts together, split overly large sections, reorder sections for better logical progression, update cross-references after restructuring

## Current Section Structure

- **Project Setup** - Initial configuration and communication guidelines
- **Code Quality** - Convention following and security practices  
- **Development Workflow** - Task management, Git integration, testing
- **Effective Prompting** - Communication best practices with examples
- **Common Pitfalls to Avoid** - Anti-patterns and mistakes to prevent
- **Collaboration** - Team integration and documentation practices

## Content Standards

- Use imperative mood for headings and guidelines
- Include practical examples with code blocks where applicable
- Use ❌/✅ pattern for contrasting good vs. bad practices
- Keep paragraphs concise and scannable
- End sections with actionable takeaways
- Maintain consistent formatting and style throughout
